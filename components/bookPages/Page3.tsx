				<h1>Getting Technical ...</h1>
				<p><strong>React</strong>: Animations over different pages are cool and breathe life into the site. They also add a little bit of complexity that gives me an excuse to use React. I use portal to make React work with the javascript imported from the PageFlip package. A React custom hook is also created to turn on and off animation depending on which page is navigated to.</p>
				<p><strong>CSS modules</strong>: In my humble opinion, the biggest problem with CSS is its global scope. CSS modules is a simple approach to address this problem directly without compromising any functionality that css provides. Since create-react-app already has this feature pre-configured, I decided to give it a try. The official github doc for CSS modules isn't that detailed. <a href='https://www.javascriptstuff.com/css-modules-by-example/'>This article</a> gives some useful examples. CSS modules can't do anything with elements created by an outside library, or created dynamically by javascript, but otherwise I think it's easy to use, and fits very well with the modular structure of react.</p>
